Hello,

This is Wai Zhung, or Tony, a student from the September 2024 Cohort of the K-Youth Program Development.
This is to ensure the submission is mine and mine only.

The project file is 'tic-tac-toe.js', and I programmed everything using Visual Code Studio.
Just want to say thank you once again for the opportunity, this was a fun project.

Best wishes,
Wai Zhung Ng.
